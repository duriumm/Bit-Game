# Bit-Game
This is my second game ever made, I have taken much inspiration from flippyBits
but i changed the formula to be easier (yes I had trouble playing it :D )

The point is to make your numbers(in the bottom) match the number on the falling enemy!
You simply convert the enemy decimal number to binary and if they match you get a point! :)
